In Data Structures:
These are the 4 basic actions you can perform.

Insertion (creation)
Search
Access
Delete

Insertion is easy, the other 3 are harder.


Hash Maps:

they are called that because a hashing function is used when a value is assigned to a key in computer memory.
So that that key is unique to that value always.

you must have a limit to reference before you assign values
